# Unity Services Authentication SDK

This package provides services for player authenticaton, unity player accounts and server authentication for Unity Gaming Services.

## Integration

Once you have installed the Authentication package, you must link your Unity project to a Unity Cloud Project using the Services window.

You need to configure the third-party login providers that you wish to use in your project in the Services Authentication window.

All services are initialized by using `UnityServices.InitializeAsync`.

## Authentication Service

The service is exposed via the `Authentication.Instance` object in the `Unity.Services.Authentication` namespace.

Once the player has been signed in, the Authentication SDK will monitor the expiration time of their access token and attempt to refresh it automatically. No further action is required.

The player's session token is cached locally in the `PlayerPrefs`. It is used to sign in again to the same account in the future.
Clearing all `PlayerPrefs` keys will require the player to sign in again from scratch on their next session.

    * Profiles are not persisted and are optional.
* `AuthenticationService.Instance.AccessToken`
  * Returns the raw string of the current access token, or null if no valid token is available (e.g. the player is signed in but the token has expired and could not be refreshed).
  * This value is updated automatically by the refresh process, so consumers should NOT cache this value.
* `AuthenticationService.Instance.SessionTokenExists`
    * Returns True if there is a cached session token.
    * The session token is updated after each login and preserved locally on the device.
