# Unity Services Authentication SDK

This package provides a service for player authenticaton for Unity Gaming Services.

## Installation

To install this package, make sure you [enable pre-release packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.1/Documentation/Manual/class-PackageManager.html#advanced_preview) in the Unity Editor's Package Manager, and then follow the [installation instructions in the Unity User Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-install.html).

## Integration

Once you have installed the Authentication package, you must link your Unity project to a Unity Cloud Project using the Services window.
You need to configure the third-party login providers that you wish to use in your project in the Services Authentication window.

The Authentication SDK automatically initializes itself on game start. You can start using the Authentication API in your code right away.
The API is exposed via the `Authentication.Instance` object in the `Unity.Services.Authentication` namespace.

Once the player has been signed in, the Authentication SDK will monitor the expiration time of their access token and attempt to refresh it automatically. No further action is required.
The player's session token is cached locally in the `PlayerPrefs`. It is used to sign in again to the same account in the future.
Clearing all `PlayerPrefs` keys will require the player to sign in again from scratch on their next session.

## Public API

### Sign-In API

* `AuthenticationService.Instance.SignedIn`
	* This is an event to which you can subscribe to be notified when the sign-in process has completed successfully.
* `AuthenticationService.Instance.SignInFailed`
	* This is an event to which you can subscribe to be notified when the sign-in process has failed for some reason.
* `AuthenticationService.Instance.SignedOut`
	* This is an event to which you can subscribe to be notified when the player has been signed out.
* `AuthenticationService.Instance.Expired`
	* This is an event to which you can subscribe to be notified when the player session expires. The session is normally refreshed automatically, but if a session fails to refresh until the expiration time, this event will trigger.
* `AuthenticationService.Instance.SignInAnonymouslyAsync(SignInOptions options = null)`
    * This triggers the anonymous sign-in processes. This will generate or use the stored session token to access the account.
    * You can provide options to control if an account should be created.
    * To create a new anonymous account, use `AuthenticationService.Instance.ClearSessionToken()` while being signed out to clear the session token before signing in.
    * If you attempt to sign in while already signed in or currently signing in, this method will throw an `AuthenticationException` with `AuthenticationErrorCodes.ClientInvalidUserState`.

* `AuthenticationService.Instance.IsExpired`
	* Returns true if the access token has expired.
* `AuthenticationService.Instance.PlayerId`
	* This property exposes the ID of the player when they are signed in, or null if they are not.

* `AuthenticationService.Instance.AccessToken`
	* Returns the raw string of the current access token, or null if no valid token is available (e.g. the player is signed in but the token has expired and could not be refreshed).
	* This value is updated automatically by the refresh process, so consumers should NOT cache this value.
* `AuthenticationService.Instance.SessionTokenExists`
    * Returns True if there is a cached session token.
    * The session token is updated after each login and preserved locally on the device.
    * It can be used to authenticate the player to the same account in the future.
	* You can use `AuthenticationService.Instance.ClearSessionToken()` to clear the token from the local cache.
* `AuthenticationService.Instance.PlayerInfo`
	* Returns the current player's player info, such as account creation time and linked external ids.
    * This is only partially loaded during sign in operations.
    * Use `AuthenticationService.Instance.GetPlayerInfoAsync()` to load the all the player info.
